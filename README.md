# Video Processing Tool Extravaganza

Welcome to my Video Processing Tool! Ever felt like your life needed a laugh track or maybe just a fast-forward button? Well, we can't do anything about the laugh track, but we've got you covered on speeding things up!

## What is This?

This tool isn't just another run-of-the-mill video editor. No, it's a quirky twist on processing videos with options. Customize your videos to fit the perfect moment on any social platform. 

## Features

- **Speed Control**: Because sometimes life needs a little fast-forwarding—or maybe a slow-mo to catch the details.
- **Mute Options**: Got something annoying in the background? Mute it! It's like turning off Newman in the middle of a rant.
- **Custom Dimensions**: Optimize for TikTok, Instagram, or whatever the kids are using these days.
- **Length Adjustment**: Choose to cut to the shorter video's length or loop the shorter video.

## Why use it?

Why not? Life's too short to watch long, drawn-out videos. Speed 'em up, cut 'em short, or just loop the good parts. It's video processing—simple, funny, and a little neurotic.
